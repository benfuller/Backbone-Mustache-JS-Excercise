Backbone-Mustache-JS-Excercise
==============================

An example excercise working with Backbone JS and Mustache JS given by a potential client. The image files are screenshots of views that need to be replicated. The exercise.js file contains the instructions which are also copied below. The index.html file is a HTML5 compliant stub that included Backbone, Mustache, JQuery, and Bootstrap. Allows the user to edit the presented model. "Change"ing an entry updates the model, pressing Save renders the View/Presentation template with the updated Model and would send the data to persistent storage via REST.

==========

I added two templates, for presentation/view and for editing the entry.

exercise.js
===========

Added the Backbone view, hooked the template, and rendered it through Mustache. Added functions to perform events and calculate additional info for the presentation/view.

This excercise took about 2 hours since I had to brush up on Backbone and Mustache was new to me.
